OPFN is developing a purely functional application platform. We call the platform an "operating function" and it is defined as a pure function of its event input stream. The system is based on a principled restriction of lambda calculus using [supercombinators](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800068.802129).

We hypothesize that by extending typed functional programming to the entire OS environment, small teams will be able to outcompete Big Tech. Our system is fast, provides automatic durable execution, metaprogramming, and has been designed to run with almost no dependencies.
